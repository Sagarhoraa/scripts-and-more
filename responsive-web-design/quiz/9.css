Step 9
As described in the freeCodeCamp Style Guide, the logo should retain an aspect ratio of 35 / 4, and have padding around the text.

First, change the background-color to #0a0a23 so you can see the logo. Then, use the aspect-ratio property to set the desired aspect ratio to 35 / 4. Finally, add a padding of 0.4rem all around.

body {
    background: #f5f6f7;
    color: #1b1b32;
    font-family: Helvetica;
    margin: 0;
  }
  
  #logo {
    width: max(10rem, 18vw);
    background-color: #0a0a23;
    aspect-ratio: 35 / 4;
    padding :0.4rem;
  
  }
